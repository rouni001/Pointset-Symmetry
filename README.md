### DESCRIPTION
This project contains the Python scripts used to analyze a point set and find
its symmetry lines.

### VERSION
0.1.1

### COMPONENTS:
This project is composed of modules:

**constants**: Containing constants values used by the algorithm and helper functions.
**file_data_importer**: Containing the code for importing raw data of the point set.
**point**: Data model for the 2D point.
**pointset**: Data model for the point set.
**pointset_symmetry_analyzer**: The core class for analyzing the point set and find its
symmetry lines.
**pointset_symmetry_viewer**: A class for visualizing results, written for
testing / debugging purposes. A more advanced class can be designed for presenting 
results.
**tests**: Folder containing data and results used for testing.

### REQUIREMENTS & VERSION
