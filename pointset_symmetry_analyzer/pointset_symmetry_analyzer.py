    Provides static methods to identify the symmetry lines existing in a 
    point set. Here is implemented the fast/optimized algorithm for processing
    the points as defined in a PointSet object.

    Static Methods:
        find_symmetry: Returns the symmetry lines, directions and 
            points at their edges, from a PointSet object.
        is_symmetric: Check whether a line is a symmetry line
            giving the topology of the pointset.
        create_symmetry_lines_endpoints: Returns coordinates of the symmetry 
            lines.
        infer_next_symmetric: Populates the SymmetryLineSet object with new 
            symmetry lines inferred from "new_symmetry_line" and the known 
            symmetry lines.
